          <p>I gave this talk at several times between 2013 and 2015 to the students of the <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive">General Assembly web development immersive course</a>.  They were learning ruby and ruby on rails as part of this course and the goal of the talk was to introduce them to the ruby scene in London.</p>
          <p>The talk is split into two parts.  In <a href="#part-1">the first part</a> I try to convince them that becoming part of a tech community outside work and study is a good idea.  Hopefully having convinced them of this <a href="#part-2">the second part</a> introduces the various ruby communities in London and beyond.</p>
          <p>The transcript comes from my presenter notes so aren’t an exact copy of what I said.  The talk mentions events and versions of software which are clearly out of date now, but were current when I gave the talk.  I’d update the notes each time I gave the talk and the version presented here uses the notes from the last time I gave the talk in September 2015.</p>

              <p>Hi!

              <p>You’ve all been learning ruby here at General Assembly for the last 4 or 5 weeks, and I’ve been asked me along to talk to you about the ruby community outside of these 4 walls.  Some of you might have already been looking around to see what else is out there, and that’s great, I hope I don’t bore you too much!  For the rest of you this should act as a an introduction to that community and an explanation of why you might care.</p>

              <p>I’m mostly going to talk about the ruby community in London, but I’ll also cover the rest of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, Europe and further afield.  The world is small now so it’s good to know what is going on elsewhere.</p>

              <p>Before we start properly, there’ll be urls in these slides, and I’ll mention things you should look up, but don’t worry about making notes:  I’ll send a <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr> round afterwards.  There’ll be time for questions at the end too, but feel free to ask anything along the way.  So.. let’s get started.</p>

              <p>So, who am I to be talking to you…</p>

              <p>I first used ruby in 2003, have been paid to use it since 2006, and have been organising <a href="http://lrug.org/"><abbr title="London Ruby User Group">LRUG</abbr></a> since 2007.  I work for an agency called <a href="http://unboxed.co/">Unboxed Consulting</a><a name="fn-1-return" href="#fn-1"><sup>1</sup></a> that specialises in agile and ruby on rails.  If after this course you are looking for work as a ruby dev, you could do worse than getting in touch with us to see if we’re hiring.</p>

            <div class="transcript">
              <p>If at the end of this you’re not super bored of me you can find and follow me online on most services using either <code>h-lame</code>, or for services that can’t handle what punctuation in the username might break: <code>hlame</code>.  (Pro-tip: let folk choose whatever they want as their username, they know how they’d like to be addressed, just make it a large <code><abbr title="Unicode Transformation Format – 8-bit">utf8</abbr></code> field in the database and be done).</p>

            <div class="transcript">
              <p>Before I talk about the community though I want to talk a little about why you might care.  I want to explain what being a developer is really about, and how being part of a community helps with that.  I assume that because you are here learning ruby what you want is to be a developer at the end.  Maybe a contractor, maybe an employee, maybe a startup founder, who knows.  No matter what you end up doing after this, the one constant is that you’re not done learning.  Being a developer means…</p>

            <div class="transcript">
              <p>always. be. learning.</p>

              <p>Seriously.  It’s what being a developer is.  Let’s think about the technology you’ve been learning so far: <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>.</p>

              <p><a href="http://ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> is now 2.2, but that <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2014/12/25/ruby-2-2-0-released/">came out at the end of last year</a>, and development on 2.3 is underway; it’s probably coming out towards the end of this year.  Rails is currently at version 4.2, also <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2014/12/19/Rails-4-2-final/">released at the end of last year</a> and the core team are already talking about what version 5.0 might contain; there were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJVTM7mE1Cc">some hints at this years RailsConf</a><a name="fn-2-return" href="#fn-2"><sup>2</sup></a>.  Each of those brings new <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s and new ways of doing things.  And that’s just the two main technologies; there’s loads of other libraries involved and all of those are constantly upgrading.</p>

              <p>I spend a good chunk of each month reading blog posts about new technology, or new approaches to old problems; watching videos of talks online; reading bug reports and wiki pages of software tools I want to use to evaluate them.  I even spend a good chunk of each day googling for the correct <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> syntax to use!</p>

              <p>I don’t say this to daunt you.  Just to put your mind at ease, I’m sure that right now you think “oh there’s so much to learn”, and you’re worried about how you’ll get it all.  That is what every developer is feeling ALL THE TIME.  Just don’t worry about it, what you’re really learning is a very acute and hyper-powerful ability to seek out information.  It’s daunting, but it’s exciting.</p>

          <section class="numbered talk-section" id="slide-006">
            <div class="slides">
              <img class="slide" src="http://assets.h-lame.com/images/talks/being-part-of-a-community/slides/006.png" title="Slide 6: from artist to programmer" alt="text: from artist to programmer, http://srcvideo2010.herokuapp.com/show_video/4/1">

              <p>So, you’re going to spend a lot of time reading stuff or watching videos.  But that’s not all,  there are 2 other ways to learn; practice and discussion, and you need to be comfortable with them both.</p>

              <p>There’s an excellent talk called <a href="http://srcvideo2010.herokuapp.com/show_video/4/1">“From Artist To Programmer”</a> given by <a href="http://keavy.co.uk/">Keavy McMinn</a> at the <a href="http://scottishrubyconference.com">Scottish Ruby Conference in 2010</a> that I think cover both of these types of learning really well.</p>

              <p>She talks about her time at art school and how there’s stuff we could learn from that to improve our craft as programmers.</p>

            <div class="transcript">
              <p>As an artist you spend a long part of your training just sketching the same thing over and over again in different styles.  It helps hone your craft as an artist.</p>

              <p>Her point, and I agree, is that as programmers we should do the same thing.  So every so often, take a break from day-to-day work to run through a simple problem and work on something entirely different, just to let you flex your coding muscles in a different way.  Look at things like coding <a href="http://code.joejag.com/2009/the-coding-dojo.html">dojos</a>, <a href="http://codekata.com/">katas</a>, <a href="http://rubykoans.com/">koans</a>, or <a href="http://rubyquiz.com/">“programming quiz” challenges</a> and try to do one of those once a week, or once a month or something.</p>

              <p>Also consider having your “pet problem” to try out new technologies on.  Pick a problem you know how to solve (a blogging app, a todo list, some kind of fun algorithm like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a>, whatever your final project is here) and then try to solve it in a different way (use different libraries, a different programming language, force a constraint like no <code>if</code> statements).  This lets you focus on the technology challenges rather than the problem<a name="fn-3-return" href="#fn-3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>

            <div class="transcript">
              <p>As a developer you should get used to being able to talk about your code too.</p>

              <p>Many times I’ve been stuck on a problem, called over someone for help, and as I’m talking it through with them I realise the solution without them saying anything.  This isn’t because I’m some super genius; it’s because the first thing you do when describing a problem to someone else is work it out properly in your own head.  Often we’re just stuck thinking about the wrong thing and explaining to someone else is the best way to step back and see the bigger picture.</p>

              <p>Apart from asking for help with something you’re stuck on you need to be comfortable explaining code you’ve written to colleagues who have to work on it next, or explaining an entire app to a new starter.</p>

              <p>You’ll want to be able to write about your work on a blog.  Maybe for marketing purposes. Maybe because it’s brand-new-exciting-work.  Maybe because you want to write up something you were proud of, even if you know many other people have done it before you, because it’s the first time <em>you’ve</em> done it.  Someone else will find that blog post and it’ll be the first time they’ve ever heard of the thing you did so you might inspire them too.</p>

              <p>Finally you should feel confident in getting up and talking about work you’ve done at meetups or internal sessions.  Someone will might say “Oh, that’s wrong”, but don’t worry about it.  Maybe they’re right, maybe they’re wrong, but you’ll have a useful discussion about it with them that you both learn from.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="transcript">
              <p>Pretty much everything I’ve said so far comes down to stuff you do on your own (there is even a technique where you talk through problems with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubber-duck</a> in the place of a real colleague).  What I want to talk about next is the stuff you need others for.</p>

              <p>You should have a circle of peers.  You’ll find plenty of find videos, articles, new tools to use on your own, but this will be mostly focussed on what you’re already using and technology you already know.  Your peers will send you the stuff you didn’t know you wanted to look at; the stuff that wasn’t on your radar already.</p>

              <p>It’s invaluable to the learning process.  My circle sends me interesting articles to read, they recommend videos to watch, they let me bounce ideas off them, if I’m evaluating a tool I’ve never used before, they might already have opinions about it.  We have great discussions about design and development best practices.</p>

              <p>I would be significantly worse at my job if I didn’t have that group around me.  Some of them are friends from uni, some are my colleagues from previous jobs, more are my current colleagues at Unboxed, and then there’s just everyone else I know through involvement in the ruby community from London and around.</p>

              <p>So, you need to build that circle.  I suggest that the starting point is the people in this room.  You should definitely be keeping in touch during the this course and afterwards.  It’s good to have a core group with the same experience level as yourself, you’ll have similar concerns and ideas at around the same time, and you’ll know exactly where each other is coming from.</p>

              <p>Of course, that’s not enough as you want people more experienced to help you out, and people less experienced to make you look at things in a new way…</p>

              <p>…turned into <a href="http://codebar.io">Codebar</a>.</p>

              <p>It’s not just Ruby, (they cover html, css, javascript too), but it’s a weekly learning event every Wednesday evening in various venues around London.</p>

              <p>As they are focussed on improving diversity in tech, it has <a href="http://codebar.io/student-guide#eligibility">strict eligibility criteria for students</a>, which not all of you will meet.  I mention it to you because it’s open to everyone to act as coaches so you should all think about attending in that capacity.  You might think “I’m just learning myself, what can I coach someone on?”, but it’s useful for coaches who have recently been newbies themselves to help out:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>it’s great for you to help folk as a way to help cement your own understanding of things</li>
                <li>if someone asked me “what’s a good resource to learn ruby” - I can’t answer, as it’s nearly 10 years since I had to.  If someon asks you however, it’s only been a few months since you started the same journey so you’re full of tips about stuff you’ve used recently that you can pass on.
              </ol>

              <p>They started in London, but there are now regular meetings in Brighton, Birmingham, and Cambridge too.  The London meetings are so popular they now have three chapters every week!</p>

              <p>They even run a few day long event called, their most recent was <a href="https://codebar.io/events/mind-the-code">Mind the Code on June 6th in London</a>, and are planning one in <a href="https://codebar.io/events/uncodebar">October called Uncodebar</a>.  It’s a great community you should get involved.</p>

              <p>The next group to talk about is <a href="http://rubybizuk.com/">RubyBizUK</a>.

              <p>It was started in May 2009 as a daytime meetup for folk who use ruby, but it’s notionally business focussed.  Less about developer technique, more about business technique.  They meet up on the 2nd Wednesday of the month and have just moved to <a href="http://lantanacafe.co.uk/lantana-cafe-shoreditch/">Lantana in Shorditch</a>.</p>

              <p>They say: <blockquote>Let’s get together and chat about best practice Ruby Development, and do some good old fashioned business networking. Mostly for Ruby consultants and owners of software development shops, although any people interested in the subject are welcome!</blockquote></p>

              <p>It’s pretty informal, just a coffee and chat really, but very good resource if you have flexible working arrangements.  It’s a good mix of people too, not just developers, but other people interested in running a business with ruby - I’ve met recruiters, accountants, and people looking for a business partner at these events.</p>

              <p>The next meeting is: Wednesday October 14th! (They just had the September one on the 10th)</p>

              <p><abbr title="London Ruby User Group">LRUG</abbr> has been around for a while.  There were some meetings way back in 2000 or 2001.  Probably no more than 10 people, meeting in pubs or cafes to talk about Ruby.  It’s unlikely any of them were actually using Ruby for their day job.  The only reason I know about this is that I met <a href="http://www.davidablack.net/">David A. Black</a> at a conference and we ended up chatting about it when I told him I was running <abbr title="London Ruby User Group">LRUG</abbr>.</p>

Both are a few years old now, and Well Grounded Rubyist is actually version 2 of Ruby for Rails, but they’re both good books for the folk new to ruby.  I used to caveat this recommendation because Well Grounded Rubyist was quite old (it covered Rails 2), but the <a href="http://www.manning.com/black3/">2nd edition</a> of it came out at the end of last year and is fully up to date.

              <p>Anyway, <abbr title="London Ruby User Group">LRUG</abbr> in it’s current incarnation was started in 2005 just around the time Ruby (because of Rails) was becoming tech you might actually get paid to do.  I started attending when I switched from Java to Ruby in 2006.  Back then we probably had about 30 people on a good day.  I took over organisational duties in January 2007.  The popularity of rails has really swelled the numbers as we went up to 80 - 100 average attendance really quickly after that (nothing to do with my organisational skills).</p>

              <p>Our meetings have a pretty set pattern.  They’re split in two, from 6:30pm to 8pm we have the formal proceedings.</p>

              <p>They look <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/snowblink/2574309878/">a lot like this</a>. Note that the expression on these people’s faces is “rapt with attention”, not “boredom”.</p>

              <p>The normal agenda is that we have “announcements” from the group, then at least two talks, sometimes 3, occasionally more.  Usually about something ruby related, but it can be about general development topics or technologies we might want to use ruby to interact with.</p>

              <p>Sometimes we do different things, for example in February we have our lightning talk event where we have 8 or 9 speakers doing 5-8 minute talks.   We’ve done practical events like code golf or a coding dojo too.  We try to mix it up when we get the chance.</p>

              <p>…we go to a pub for <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/snowblink/3890552430/">a more informal get together</a>.</p>

              <p>If you don’t drink that’s fine; there’s no pressure - we try to make sure the pub we attend has plenty of seating and serves food so that people can just talk and network.  It really is a great opportunity as the speakers are usually in attendance so you can talk to them in more detail about their talk if you were particularly interested in it.</p>

              <p>It’s worth pointing out that many people from my “circle of peers” come from this part of the meeting.</p>

              <p>So that’s what <abbr title="London Ruby User Group">LRUG</abbr> is, why should you get involved?</p>

              <p>There’s the learning stuff I talked about earlier.  Even if a talk isn’t immediately relevant to your current project, it might be next month, or next year.  Or it might twist some lock in your brain and let you see your current project in a different light.</p>

              <p>There’s also the announcements bit at the start.  I call it announcements, but it’s really the “we’re hiring” section.  Even if people don’t announce that they’re hiring, when you talk to them in the pub you’ll find that most people won’t turn away a job applicant.  The ruby scene is incredibly under-staffed.</p>

              <p>The pub bit after a meeting is a great networking event and I mean that in the least shabby, trading-business-cards sense, and more in the getting to know people that you might work with in a couple of years time sense.</p>

              <p>Even if you don’t come to the meetings (but you should), sign up to the mailing list.  The traffic is pretty low, but a fairly decent chunk of it is tagged <code>[JOBS]</code> and there are loads of people recruiting.  Yes you’re up against everyone else on the mailing list, but the reason so many people are hiring is because there aren’t enough rubyists to go round!  You’ve got a good chance at any of these jobs.</p>

Maybe you could be the person that keeps them going?</p>

              <p>No matter where you are in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, it should be possible for you to find a Ruby meetup and wherever you find a ruby meetup it means there are people being paid to use ruby in local companies.   Which in turn means you can live there and be paid to use ruby.  Don’t let anyone tell you that you have to stay in London to work in technology.</p>

              <p>If there isn’t a ruby group, just start one, it’s not hard!  I can give you some advice afterwards if you want it, but all you need to do is let people know you’re doing it<a name="fn-6-return" href="#fn-6"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>

              <p>Of course, user groups aren’t the only way to get involved.  There are the conferences.  So many conferences.</p>

              <p>A user group is usually a fairly informal, local get together where most attendees will know each other.  Maybe in a big place it’ll be 100 people or more (<abbr title="London Ruby User Group">LRUG</abbr> can get up to 160 for a VERY popular event).  A conference on the other hand is likely to be at least that size, but usually much bigger and draw attendees from much further afield, not just the local community.  They’re usually a whole day of talks, often 2 or maybe 3 days for a big conference.  It’s a good chance to meet the authors of the libraries you use, or chat to people you wouldn’t normally be exposed to.</p>

              <p>A good site that is ruby specific is <a href="http://rubyconferences.org/">rubyconferences.org</a>; it lists upcoming ruby confs with an option to filter by <abbr title="Call For Proposals">CFP</abbr> if you want to talk etc…  I think it’s manually updated though.</p>

              <p>A much more comprehensive site is <a href="http://lanyrd.com/">lanyrd.com</a> - although you can’t just see conferences, you’ll see user groups and basically <a href="http://lanyrd.com/topics/ruby">everything tagged with ruby</a> on there.</p>

              <p>A new entry is <a href="https://github.com/planetruby/awesome-events">https://github.com/planetruby/awesome-events</a> which is a github repo and command line tool - you can raise a <abbr title="Pull Request">PR</abbr> to add an event and you can see it online, or use their tool to find out what’s upcoming.</p>

              <p>The major <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> ruby conference was <a href="http://scottishrubyconference.com/">Scottish Ruby Conf</a>, now in it’s 6th year, based up in or near Edinburgh.  It’s the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> equivalent of a major US conference; multi-day, multi-track, big-name keynote speakers, swag, the works!  I say was because last year they said it would be the last one.  I think because the organisers mostly weren’t using ruby in their day-jobs anymore - but we’re all expecting that something similar by the same folk will happen in it’s place, so keep an eye out for something from them.  All the videos from the previous editions are available and there are some great talks, so at the very least have a look at what’s available already!</p>

              <p>The first <a href="http://bathruby.org/">Bath Ruby</a> happened earlier this year in March.  I wasn’t able to attend this conference, but heard really good things.  It had a impressive line up of speakers, and was quite cheap (less than £100).  <a href="http://confreaks.tv/events/bathruby2015">Videos are coming soon</a>.</p>

              <p>There’s <a href="http://brightonruby.com">Brighton Ruby</a>, the second of which was a couple of weeks ago.  Looks to be coming back next year too, in a bigger venue.  The <a href="http://brightonruby.com/2014/">first year</a> wasn’t filmed, but this year was and they’ll be <a href="http://brightonruby.com/2015/">coming out later in the year</a>.</p>

              <p>Finally there’s <a href="http://rubymanor.org">Ruby Manor</a> (full disclosure: I organise this with a couple of friends), based in London, there’s been 4 so far, but it’s not entirely regular (and we’re not sure we’ll do another, but never say never).  It’s the opposite of Scottish Ruby Conf; community driven, one-day, one-track, no frills.  All our videos are available <a href="http://rubymanor.org">on our website</a>.</p>

              <p>There are loads of other conferences in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> though, not just about Ruby and you should definitely use <a href="http://lanyrd.com/topics/ruby">lanyrd.com</a> to try and keep up.  Sometimes the first I hear about something is the stream of tweets from attendees talking about how good it is!<a name="fn-7-return" href="#fn-7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

              <p>I won’t mention them all, seriously, there are LOADS!</p>

              <p>Just pick out a few that are “important”.</p>

              <p>First up, and closest to home is: <a href="http://euruko.org">EuRuKo</a></p>

              <p>It’s the major ruby conf in europe and doesn’t have a permanent home.  Instead the attendees vote for which city to hold it in the following year.  It’s was in <a href="http://euruko2013.org/">Athens in 2013</a> and was supposed to be in <a href="http://www.euruko2014.org">Kiev in 2014</a> (but they had to <a href="http://www.euruko2014.org/#blog/post/1/">cancel because of the political situation</a> - shame).  Happily they’re organising it this year (2015) in <a href="http://www.euruko2015.org/">Salzburg, Austria</a> and tickets are on sale for just €65.</p>

              <p>There’s another smaller conf called <a href="http://rupy.eu/">RuPy</a> that does a similar thing, and it covers both Ruby and Python<a name="fn-8-return" href="#fn-8"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p>

              <p>The US hosts the two biggest confs for rubyists: <a href="http://railsconf.com/">RailsConf</a> and <a href="http://rubyconf.org/">RubyConf</a>.  Again, both tour, hitting a different city each year.  RailsConf this year (2015) was in <a href="http://railsconf.com/2015">Atlanta, Georgia at the end of April</a>, so keep an eye out for the 2016 version. RubyConf will be in <a href="http://confreaks.com/events/rubyconf2015">San Antonio, Texas on 15th-17th Nov</a>.  These are huge affairs, Rails Conf is proably a 1,000 or so attendees these days.</p>

              <p>And the regional confs. Too many to list, but it can often feel like there’s a ruby conf every other weekend in the states.  Again, if you’re planning on visiting the states it might be a good idea to see what is happening in the ruby scene, there might just be a conf on!</p>

              <p>Japan hosts the other major conference: <a href="http://rubykaigi.org/">Ruby Kaigi</a>.  Many presentations are in Japanese, but they have live translation into English (and vice-versa for talks presented in English).  The Japanese community is quite different to the western community as many Japanese rubyists are C programers who work on ruby itself.</p>

              <p>These past couple of slides have probably been a bit overwhelming.  I’m not saying you should spend all your spare time going to conferences; not least because it would be prohibitively expensive and destructive to the planet!  But, most confs publish videos of their talks, so you should keep an eye out for people at conferences mentioning great talks and then watch them when they’re released!  Much cheaper!</p>

              <p>But you should try to go to some conferences.  They are great ways to meet people and learn loads of new things.</p>

              <p>So, hopefully I’ve given you a taste of why taking part in a ruby community is a good idea, and an quick overview of what that community looks like, both locally and globally.  It’s probably time to stop though, so any questions?</p>

          <p><a name="fn-1"><sup>1.</sup></a>  We’ve since dropped the “Consulting” part of the brand.<a href="#fn-1-return"><sup>⏎</sup></a></p>
          <p><a name="fn-2"><sup>2.</sup></a>  Obviously this slide is quite out of date, I’d update it each time I gave the talk as new versions of ruby and ruby on rails were released. <a href="#fn-2-return"><sup>⏎</sup></a></p>
          <p><a name="fn-3"><sup>3.</sup></a>  Intentionally or not, what I’m describing here is the structure of a <a href="http://coderetreat.org/">code retreat</a>, even down to picking Game of Life as the project to work on. <a href="#fn-3-return"><sup>⏎</sup></a></p>
          <p><a name="fn-4"><sup>4.</sup></a>  The first railsgirls event in London was in <a href="http://www.ubelly.com/2013/05/rails-girls-london-2013/">March 2013</a>.  <a href="#fn-4-return"><sup>⏎</sup></a></p>
          <p><a name="fn-5"><sup>5.</sup></a>  The talks were run close to the next <abbr title="London Ruby User Group">LRUG</abbr> meeting so I’d update this slide each time I gave the talk to have info about the specific meeting. <a href="#fn-5-return"><sup>⏎</sup></a></p>
          <p><a name="fn-6"><sup>6.</sup></a>  This slide is hugely out of date, some of the groups I mention appear to have died out abnd others may have cropped up in other towns (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/bathruby/">Bath</a> and <a href="http://nrug.co.uk/">Norwich</a> are two I know about). It’s a shame when groups die out, but it can’t be helped.  It’s easy to start a group, it <em>is</em> hard to keep it going. <a href="#fn-6-return"><sup>⏎</sup></a></p>
          <p><a name="fn-7"><sup>7.</sup></a>  Another slide that is pretty out of date.  It seems clear that Scottish Ruby is permanently closed, and while Bath Ruby had a 2nd iteration in 2016 they announced it wasn’t happening in 2017.  Brighton Ruby seems to be the only regular ruby conference in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> now and thankfully it goes from strength-to-strength.  Ruby Manor may return, but we’re in no rush. <a href="#fn-7-return"><sup>⏎</sup></a></p>
          <p><a name="fn-8"><sup>8.</sup></a>  RuPy rebranded as <a href="http://polyconf.com/">PolyConf</a> for 2014, so this slide was out of date almost as soon as I wrote it. <a href="#fn-8-return"><sup>⏎</sup></a></p>
