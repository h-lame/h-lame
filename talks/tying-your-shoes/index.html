          <p>I gave this talk at <a href="http://rubymanor.org/classic/">Ruby Manor Classic</a>.  I gave it alongside <a href="https://twitter.com/martinbtt">Martin Sadler</a> as a two parter about building <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr>s with Ruby.  Martin spoke about using <a href="http://monkeybars.rubyforge.org/">monkeybars</a> via Jruby, and we had a shared intro.  This transcript only covers my part of the talk, not the shared intro, and not Martinʼs bit.</p>
          <p>The transcript comes from my presenter notes and these were a first draft, so itʼs very unlikely to be a word-for-word copy of what I said on the day.  It should be very close though.</p>

            <p>His first attempt at Hackety-hack used an embedded <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Gecko">Gecko</a> engine and a lot of the <abbr title="User Interface">UI</a> was pretty much <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.  However, it seems that this didn’t cut it for some reason, perhaps it was too complex to make changes to or perhaps embedding Gecko was too prone to oddness. I’m not really sure.</p>

          <div class="transcript">
            <p>As you might imagine from something designed to replace an embedded <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> rendering engine, Shoes is heavily influenced by <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.  To me it’s always felt like a weird combo of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading StyleSheets">CSS</abbr>.  Except, rather than learning three syntaxes and splitting everything over three files (if you’re doing it semantically, unobtrusively and presentationally); you’re learning one syntax (ruby) and defining everything in one place.  I think if you’re at all familiar with building apps for the web, you’ll feel completely at home very quickly with Shoes.</p>

            <p>It’s also inspired by <a href="https://www.nodebox.net/">Nodebox</a> and <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a> - so everything is a canvas.  Just imagine that a body tag is also a canvas tag and you’ll be set!</p>

          </figure>
          <div class="transcript">
            <p>You might think that installing shoes is as simple as:</p>

            <blockquote><code>gem install shoes</code></blockquote>

          </figure>
          <div class="transcript">
            <p>But unfortunately not. Unlike other ruby <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> frameworks, Shoes is not a gem.  This isn’t a quirky way of packaging it, it’s by design because it’s actually a separate ruby runtime that you download and install.  You then ask Shoes to run the programs you create, instead of your standard ruby install.   It’s based on 1.8.6 though so it should be fine.  It also has gems support (using gems 1.2), so you can still use the ruby eco-system that you know and love, but not specifically the one that you’ve pre-installed.</p>

            <p>Anyway, once at <code>shoooes.net</code> you can find the version of Shoes for your platform.</p>

            <p>It’s cross platform, currently available for <abbr title="Operating System Ten">OS X</abbr> (<abbr title="PowerPC: Performance Optimization With Enhanced RISC – Performance Computing">PPC</a> &amp; Intel, although <abbr title="PowerPC: Performance Optimization With Enhanced RISC – Performance Computing">PPC</a> tends to lag behind on some features - it took ages to get Video support into <abbr title="PowerPC: Performance Optimization With Enhanced RISC – Performance Computing">PPC</a>), Windows and Linux / <abbr title="Berkeley Software Distribution">BSD</abbr> using <abbr title="GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) ToolKit">GTK+.</p>

            <p>So let’s spruce it up a bit, we’ll give it a title and give it a nice crisp white background.</p>

            <p>We specify the title via a styles hash on the <code>Shoes.app</code> call.  We could specify other things here, such as the window size, but we’ll leave that for now.  The default is ok for us.</p>

            <p>The background colour is specified as a method.  The block passed to <code>Shoes.app</code> is evaluated in the context of the Shoes application.  So this <code>background</code> method comes from <code>Shoes.app</code>.</p>

            <p>Ohhh… what’s all this?</p>

            <p>So we’re adding a second <code>background</code> to add an image, and we’re specifically positioning it with those <code>bottom</code> and <code>right</code> style entries in the hash.  The positioning stuff should be very familiar to anyone with a passing knowledge of <abbr title="Cascading StyleSheets">CSS</abbr>.  For those with more than a passing knowledge you should recognise the multiple backgrounds stuff from <abbr title="Cascading StyleSheets version 3">CSS3</abbr> (which would get rid of things like <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/slidingdoors">the sliding doors technique</a>).</p>

            <p>Next we’re encountering this curious object called a <code>flow</code>.  We’ll come back to it later, but for now it’s enough to know that it’s a container that we can put other things in.  Note that we pass a block and everything in that block is evaluated in the context of that <code>flow</code>.  So by calling <code>background</code> here, we’re setting the background of the <code>flow</code>, not our main <code>Shoes.app</code>.  (The <code>curve</code> param passed the <code>background</code> call gives us rounded corners - sweet!)</p>

            <p>The final thing is the <code>title</code> method.  This lets us specify some text.  Text in Shoes is all based on derivatives of the <code>para</code> element and helpfully (much like <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>) provides several default styles to get you started (for example: <code>title</code>, <code>subtitle</code>, <code>caption</code>).  They act much like <code>h1</code> - <code>h6</code> and simply scale the text up and down in terms of <code>font-size</code>.</p>

            <p>To build this login box we need to start with the container for all the elements; the title, the two edit boxes, their labels, and the button.</p>

            <p>The box is a <code>stack</code>, the second of the two Shoes layout containers.  We’re applying a <code>margin</code> to it so it doesn’t fill up the whole window width and is spaced away from the main app title.  Just like <abbr title="Cascading StyleSheets">CSS</abbr> we can specify this stuff in array form, or individually with <code>margin-top</code> etc…</p>

            <p>We’ve now seen both a <code>flow</code> (used earlier to contain the main app title) and a <code>stack</code> (used here to contain the whole login <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr>).  So it’s as good a time as any to talk about the features shoes provides for laying out your <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> elements.</p>

            <p>These are the only two layout containers that Shoes provides, anyone familiar with other <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> frameworks will be used to things like <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/grid.html">Grid Layouts</a> or <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/grid.html">Compass Layouts</a> or whatever… nothing so complex with Shoes.</p>

            <p>First up are <code>stack</code>s.  Imagine all the technical books on your desk.  If you want to tidy the desk you’ll probably stack the books up on top of each other to save space.  Each book goes on top of the previous one creating a new layer in the stack with each book.</p>

            <p>That’s how it is in Shoes with <code>stack</code>s.  Each element you add to the stack creates a new vertical layer.  Except…</p>

            <p>Next are <code>flow</code>s.  Imagine an empty box of matches.  As you put matches into the box they fill up the bottom layer of the box. Once that layer is full we start filling up the next layer, until that’s filled up and we create a new layer, and so-on.</p>

            <p><code>flow</code>s in Shoes are very similar.  <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> elements in a <code>flow</code> fills up the width of the <code>flow</code> from left to right and then drop down horizontally and fill up that layer, and so on.</p>

            <p>So that’s layout in Shoes: <code>stack</code>s and <code>flow</code>s.  Which are, yes, almost exactly like inline vs block elements in <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> &amp; <abbr title="Cascading StyleSheets">CSS</abbr>.  Also, just like <abbr title="Cascading StyleSheets">CSS</abbr> you can ignore these containers and position things absolutely with <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>, <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> style attributes.</p>

            <p>It’s four things in a <code>stack</code>:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>the ‘who goes there?’ title</li>

            <p>We’ve already seen the <code>title</code> and <code>stack</code>, so here’s the rest of it.  Is this what you thought it would be?  Give yourself a clap on the back if you did.  The only weird things are the extra <code>stack</code>s around the <code>para</code>s to act as the labels.  Text elements are truly inline and don’t have specifiable widths; it's not just because they’re in a <code>flow</code> here.</p>

            <p>Other interesting things to note about this code:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>the <code>edit_line</code> - this is how you get a text box</li>
              <li>the negative <code>width</code>s on the text box, what this means is be 100% of the box wide minus <code>170px</code>.  Because this is in a <code>flow</code>, it allows us to combine stacks and other “wide-able” elements to create single “layer” of elements in the <code>flow</code>.</li>
              <li>the <code>button</code> - the block passed to the <code>button</code> is what will happen when the <code>button</code> is clicked.  This is how you add event handlers to things in Shoes.  Anyone who has written <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> event handling code in java will surely appreciate this brevity.</li>
              <li>For the first time I’m doing something with the results of these methods that create objects.  For both the user and password edit boxes I’m assigning them to instance variables (remember, everything in Shoes is evaluated in the context of <code>Shoes.app</code>, so these are instance variables available to the whole app).  Every method in Shoes returns the object you’re creating, even things like background.</li>

            <p>I mentioned at the start that Shoes is influenced by <a href="https://www.nodebox.net/">Nodebox</a> and <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>.  Everything is a canvas and it has some really powerful animation (which I touched on) and drawing (which I didn’t) features.  In recent builds _why has been building in more and more features for doing really neat graphical stuff (like filters and alpha transparency).  Thankfully also without sacrificing the simplicity of the API.  Remember, the goal of this is to power Hackety-hack, a tool for teaching kids to program.  Adding this to the fact that you can do pixel perfect layout of elements means you could do some stunning looking animated <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr>s.  For example, if you wanted a random name generator you could draw a hat that spits out stars and then picks a random name<a id="fn-2-return" href="#fn-2"><sup>2</sup></a>.  Or… something good.</p>

            <p>Speaking, as I was just briefly about tidying up the code and so on, I should point out that all the code I’ve shown you has been from one file: <a href="https://github.com/h-lame/talon/blob/master/talon.rb"><code>talon.rb</code></a>.  That’s not to say that you can’t organise your code better.  Shoes has some interesting features that could help this.  I have to say, I’ve not fully explored this aspect of Shoes, so I’m just letting you know that it’s out there.</p>

            <p>You can extend Shoes itself and this lets you define url endpoints which are methods in your Shoes class that you can call with the <code>visit</code> method.  <code>visit</code> takes a url, relative or absolute.  You can have regexp’s in the URL and any groups in the pattern become arguments to the method being <code>visit</code>ed.  The main advantage here is then being able to put your Shoes code into multiple files.</p>

            <p>It’s not clear to me the full power of advantage of this, except for the fact that the urls you <code>visit</code> can be absolute, and thus you can put shoes apps online to perhaps combine the power of a desktop app with the simplicity of updating via a central web app.</p>

            <p>Shoes has an excellent in built packaging feature.  From the “Package” menu of any Shoes app you can bundle up your Shoes code, along with Shoes and dependencies, as a Windows, <abbr title="Operating System Ten">OS X</abbr>, Linux or Shoes application.  Shoes has <a href="https://github.com/shoes/shoes/wiki/A-Developer's-Tour-Through-Shoes#shoes-packager">a cross-platform bundle called SHY</a> which you can use instead.</p>

            <p>It’s a really simple and nice way of bundling your code, much easier than any other mechanism I’ve used in the past, and it’s awesome that it’s built in.</p>

            <p>So, that’s it.</p>

            <p>Hopefully I’ve whetted your appetite for Shoes, if you want to know more there are excellent resources out there about shoes.  First is the shoes manual, which is built into every shoes app.  Press cmd m to make it appear.  Then go and get a copy of <a href="https://cloud.github.com/downloads/shoes/shoes/nks.pdf">“nobody knows shoes”</a>.  Then explore the rest.</p>
