            <p>The key word in my title is “rough”; Iʼm coming to the material with little or no practical knowledge.  Iʼm not using 1.9 in my day job, and although I probably would use it for any spare-time hacking, itʼs very rare that I get down to any as I am, basically, lazy.</p>

            <p>So apologies to anyone that knows this stuff already; I might get things wrong, or not cover everything in enough detail.  Iʼm sorry.</p>

          <div class="transcript">
            <p>Fibers are an implementation of 2 important ideas:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The first idea is “co-routines” (and this should sound familiar, as you’ll have heard of sub-routines which are related)</li>
              <li>The second idea is “co-operative multitasking” (and again, you should recognise this as similar sounding to “pre-emptive mutlitasking”).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Weʼll take a quick detour to cover these in turn and then weʼll come back to Ruby.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="transcript">
            <p>Pretty much every method or function you’ve ever written is a sub-routine.  When you invoke them you start at the first line and run through them till they terminate and give you their result.</p>

            <p>A co-routine is a little bit different.  When you invoke them they also start on the first line of code but they can halt execution and exit before they terminate.  Later you can then re-enter and resume execution from where you left off.</p>

            <p>It’s also unlikely you’ll have written one, yet, as despite being around for a while not many languages provide them as a feature.</p>

        <section class="talk-section numbered" id="slide-004">

          </div>
          <div class="transcript">
            <p>Here’s a simple subroutine example.</p>

            <p>When you call a method the flow of control enters the function, and is trapped until the method terminates.</p>

            <p>Once the method terminates, here with an explicit <code>return</code>, but it could be an exception, or simply stopping after the last executable statement of the code path, the flow of control is finally released to the caller.</p>
          </div>

          </div>
          <div class="transcript">
            <p>Once you exit a sub-routine, the door is closed; you can’t return to it the way you came out.</p>

            <p>To re-use the sub-routine, your only option is to re-invoke it and go back to the first line of code.  This creates a new copy of the entire stack, so there’s nothing shared between this invocation and the previous ones, or any future ones.  Depending on your code, this could be expensive.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="transcript">
            <p>And here’s a similar example for a co-routine.</p>

            <p>It starts pretty much the same way. The flow of control enters the method and is trapped until it provides a result, this time with a <code>yield</code>.  However, unlike before, we can <code>resume</code> the method and send the flow of control back in to continue working, picking up where we were when we left off.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="transcript">
            <p>What makes co-routines even more interesting is that we can <code>yield</code> and <code>resume</code> as many times as we want, until, of course, the co-routine comes to a natural termination point.</p>

            <p>We can also have as many <code>yield</code>’s as we want, we don’t always have to <code>yield</code> from the same place.  Although having <code>yield</code>ed at a given point, we <code>resume</code> at that point, we can’t choose some other <code>yield</code> point to re-enter at.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="transcript">
            <p>You should be familiar with pre-emptive multitasking as it’s the standard model of concurrency used by most Thread implementations.</p>

            <p>You have several tasks running at the same time, scheduled by the <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> or language runtime.  The gotcha is access to shared objects.</p>

            <p>Fibers however use the co-operative model.  With this no tasks run at the exact same time and it’s up to the programmer to decide when each task will give up control and who to pass control onto.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="transcript">
            <p>The main problem with pre-emptive multitasking is that (on a single core machine) these two threads are given <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> time arbitrarily by some scheduler.  They don’t know when in their life-cycle this’ll happen, so when thread alpha wants to access the shared data, it has to lock it.  Unfortunately this means the shared data could remain locked while thread beta has the <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> time, so thread beta can’t do anything.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="transcript">
            <p>On the other hand, in co-operative multitasking, the fiber itself has explicit control of when the <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> will transfer away.  This means it doesn’t need to lock anything because it’s safe in the knowledge that no other fiber will be running unless it says it’s done.</p>

            <p>When the fiber is done (or happy that it’s done enough for now), it stops accessing the shared data and simply transfers control away to some other fiber.</p>

            <p>I’ve bored you with the science part, how about looking at some code?</p>

            <p>If you’ve used threads in ruby this should be familiar. You create a <code>Fiber</code> by passing a block to a constructor.  The block is the “work load” for that fiber.  In this case an infinite loop to generate increasingly excited hellos to the <abbr title="London Ruby User Group">LRUG</abbr> crowd.  Don’t worry about that pesky “infinite” though…</p>

          </div>
          <div class="transcript">
            <p>When you create a fiber, again just like a thread, it won’t do anything until you ask it to.  To start it you call the somewhat chicken-before-the-egg <code>resume</code> method.  This causes <code>hello_lrug</code> to run until it hits that <code>Fiber.yield</code>.  This pauses execution of the fiber and returns the value passed to it.  You also use <code>resume</code> to re-enter the fiber to do some more work.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section class="talk-section numbered" id="slide-013">

          </div>
          <div class="transcript">
            <p>So although we gave <code>hello_lrug</code> a workload that <strong>will never end</strong>, it’s not a problem because we use the <code>yield</code> and <code>resume</code> methods to explicitly schedule when <code>hello_lrug</code> runs.  If we only want to run it 5 times and never come back to it, that’s ok, it won’t eat up <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> time.  This gives us an interesting new way to think about writing functions; if they don’t have to end lazy evaluation becomes super easy.</p>

            <p>Hey, so what’s a talk without <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci</a>?</p>

            <p>Here’s the standard implementation for generating a number in the fibonacci sequence using ruby.  It uses recursion, which is something you have to get your head around before you see how it works, and that can be hard sometimes, and you have to take care to have correct guard clauses to make sure you terminate the recursion.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="transcript">
            <p>Here’s the fibrous way of doing it.  Again, there is a fundamental concept you need to understand first (co-routines), but I do think this is a slightly more natural way of defining the sequence.</p>

            <p>The difference is that to get the 6th number, we have to call resume on the fiber 6 times.  With the side-effect of being provided with all the preceding 5 numbers in the sequence.</p>

            <p>This sort of lazy evalutation is where Fibers shine, and probably where they’ll see the most use.</p>

            <p>And, in fact, it’s exactly this sort of thing that <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ruby_Programming/Reference/Objects/Enumerable">Fibers are being used for in the ruby 1.9 stdlib</a>.  Things like <code>.each</code> and <code>.map</code> have been reworked so that without a block they now return enumerators that you can chain together.  And under the hood these enumerators are implemented using fibers.</p>

            <p>That’s all a bit theoretical.  What real use are fibers?</p>

            <p>Well, I don’t know, so I did <a href="https://github.com/search?l=Ruby&q=fiber&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93">a quick search on github</a>, and to my surprise there were actually plenty of results.</p>

            <p>But… on closer inspection, the first few pages are entirely forks and copies of the <a href="https://github.com/ruby/spec/tree/master/library/fiber">Ruby specs for fibers</a>.  Which, by the way, I totally recommend reading if you want to get an idea how something in ruby actually works.</p>

          <div class="transcript">
            <p>Well… another <i>quick</i> detour.  If you’ve ever done any evented programming you’ll know that the code is very different looking to normal code.</p>

            <p>Here’s a simplified example of how to read a webpage.  For the normal case it’s really simple, you just call a couple of methods.</p>

            <p>The evented case, not so much.  You have to rely on callback methods and keep some object around to hold the result of those callbacks.  What you lose in a simplified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> you gain in performance and flexibility, but it’s hard to get your head around<a name="fn-1-return" href="#fn-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>

            <p>The first non-ruby spec result on github that uses fibers was: <a href="https://github.com/oldmoe/neverblock">Neverblock</a><a name="fn-2-return" href="#fn-2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>

            <p>This library uses Fibers, <a href="http://rubyeventmachine.com/">Event Machine</a> and other non-blocking <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s to present you with an <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> for doing asynchronous programming that looks remarkably synchronous.  So you don’t have to change your code to get the benefit of asynchronous performance.</p>

            <p>I won’t go into details (I only have 1 more slide!), but you should check it out if you’re interested.</p>

Lightweight - less memory over head than threads. The downsides - single core only really">

            <p>Last slide.  There’s loads I didn’t cover, but I think I got the basics.</p>

            <p>There are 3 remaining <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> methods (apart from <code>resume</code> and <code>yield</code>) which I already covered.  <code>Fiber#transfer</code> is like <code>yield</code>, but instead of giving <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> back to the caller, you give it to the fiber you called <code>transfer</code> on.  The other two are simple enough.</p>

            <p>Fibers are supremely lightweight: spinning up fibers takes much less memory than spinning up a thread.  There’s <a href="http://oldmoe.blogspot.co.uk/2008/08/ruby-fibers-vs-ruby-threads.html">a good comparison from the author of the Neverblock gem</a>.</p>

            <p>The downside is that they are a single-core solution really, and weʼre increasingly heading towards a multi-core world.</p>

          <p><a name="fn-1"><sup>1.</sup></a> To be fair to the evented code, the <code>open</code> method is a blunt abstraction that wraps up some gnarly <code>Net::HTTP</code> code thatʼs not much better than the evented code in the slide.  I guess I wanted to make Neverblock look like a better idea.  <a href="#fn-1-return"><sup>⏎</sup></a></p>
